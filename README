What is Barnum?
===============

Barnum is a python-based application for quickly and easily creating 
pseudo-random data typically used for application testing.

Why did you create Barnum?
==========================

I am developing a shopping cart application in Django and realized that I 
needed a bunch of data to simulate the store's behavior under somewhat normal 
production usage.  

I got tired of always trying to think of names and addresses for customers and 
so decided to automate the process a little bit.  Such was born Barnum.

Why is Barnum unique?
=====================

I was able to find some online systems for generating large amounts of test 
data.  I could not find any application that had the breadth of data generation 
capabilities nor the ability to easily interface with Django in the way I 
wanted to.

One of the most unique aspects of Barnum is that the data is what I'll call
"plausible."  For example, here's an example "identity" randomly generated
from Barnum -
    Sid Seymour
    10 Kimbrough Grove Drive
    Arthur ND, 58006
    (701)642-6471

    Who works at:
    Network Hardware Co as a Personnel Clerk Senior

You should notice a couple of things about this data.
 - There's a realistic first and last name
 - The street names are also plausible
 - Arthur, ND is a real city and the zip code is 58006
 - 701 is an area code used for North Dakota 
 - The fictional company is somewhat reasonable.
 - The job position also makes sense.

Why not just use Random to create strings of letters?
=====================================================

Well, I find that when testing applications, if it's just a random string
of numbers of letters, it gets hard to tell if something is out of place
or "looks wrong."  If you'd like to jus generate totally random information,
then you probably don't need Barnum!

What type of information does Barnum generate?
==============================================

Here's a list of types of dummy data Barnum can create:
 - First name and/or last name in either gender
 - Job title
 - Phone number
 - Street number and name
 - Zip code plus city & state
 - Company name
 - Credit card number and type
 - Dates
 - Email addresses
 - Sample password
 - Words (latin)
 - Sentences and/or paragraphs of random latin words
